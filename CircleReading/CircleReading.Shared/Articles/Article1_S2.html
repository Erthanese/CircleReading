<p>A small Canadian town forms in the middle of the Kuwait desert. Shovels dig into the yellow sand, prefab huts go up one by one. Six hundred soldiers have moved in, next to the scorching airstrip, their 10 airplanes parked nearby: seven CF-18 jet fighters, two Aurora reconnaissance planes and a Polaris aerial refueller.

Canada has pitched its tent with the US-led coalition against <a>ISIS</a>, the radical Sunni Muslim militant group which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria, terrorizing—and often executing—those in its way. Its aim is to topple the governments of both of those countries to create one huge Islamic state that is stricter in its interpretation of the Koran than either Afghanistan’s Taliban or Saudi Arabia next door. The coalition’s aim is to destroy it.

The coalition’s mandate is also a problem. It says there will be no fighting ground troops in either Iraq or Syria. This will be almost entirely an air war, using missiles and bombs to attack <a>ISIS</a> positions, to disrupt supply lines and back up Iraqi government and Kurdish Peshmerga forces.

Canada’s mandate only allows missions over Iraq, not Syria. It does not envisage fighting ground troops, though members of Canada’s Joint Task Force 2, the elite special forces, have been involved in training Kurdish soldiers in combat zones. Canada’s mission has been approved for six months by Parliament, but even top generals say a year is more realistic. U.S. officials predict a multi-year campaign.

Some even wonder whether the coalition has enough useful targets to hit from the air. U.S. officials have noticed enemies changing their tactics, hiding more among civilian populations, where they’re almost impossible to hit without casualties that would be politically unpalatable at home.</p>
